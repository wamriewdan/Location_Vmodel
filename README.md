# Location_Vmodel_Project
This repository contains codes and test dataset to reproduce the results/ images in the manuscript: Joint microseismic location and velocity model update.
The codes are written 100% in python and can be run by simply calling the .py files either on the command line or on Jupyter notebooks or any other python supporting platforms.

Requirements:
- Python version 2.7 and above
- Tensorflow version 2.0 and above (for the file Figures7_8_9_10.py)
- Keras version 2.24 and above (for the file Figures7_8_9_10.py)

Execution:
Download/ clone the repository and unzip it to preferable location in your computer.
Navigate to the files location and either;
 - type on the command line  "python filename" without the ("")marks or,
 - open a jupyter notebook on your browser, import the files and run them or copy the code to a new notebook and execute.
 - optional: uncomment to save the images at a directory of choice
 
Notes:
 - Run the file "Figures7_8_9_10.py" to produce Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10.
 - Run the file "Figure11_Coherent_Noise_Histogram.py" to produce figure 11.
 - Due to the large volumes of data involved, only 25 samples of velocity model have been included in the test dataset provided here. Full dataset can be obtained by contacting the author.
